Python Coding Problems
======================

Beginner programming challenges in Python.

### Setup

Problems in this repo should be done using Python 3+. If you want, you can set up a `virtualenv` (how to do this will not be covered in this README) to point to Python 3.x 

Each problem directory has a problem statement in a Markdown (md) file, and a test suite to execute for validation. To test your code, just run `python problemX_test.py`, where X is the problem number.

Example: `python problem1_test.py`

Running this will show number of successes and failures for the code.

There is a prerequisite reading document within each problem section 
(other than the advanced problems section). The readings are done in the README for
each subfolder.
