You're given a rectangular Pitri dish for a computer
to scan. The computer program is able to identify a 
specific species of amoeba within a sector of the 
Pitri dish. The program outputs an N x M grid of 1's 
or 0's. A 1 in the grid indicates that the cell 
contains an amoeba. A 0 indicates there isn't an amoeba 
covering that cell. This is a very particular amoeba that 
only stretches out in the four cardinal directions: north,
south, east, and west. Amoeba will not collide with each other,
and will never stretch diagonally.

The Problem:
============
You are tasked with taking the output of the computer vision 
program and determining how many amoebas exist on the Pitri 
dish. Given a grid of N x M 1's and 0's, return the number 
of amoebas that exist on the dish.

Assumptions:
- 1's that are only connected diagonally do not count as the same entity

Examples: 
In: 5x5 grid
1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1
0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 
1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
Out: 4
Explanation:
At (0,0) there is an amoeba
At (1,1) there is an amoeba
At (3,4) there is an amoeba
There is a single amoeba that spans the coordinates: 
[(0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1)]

In: 3x3 grid
1 | 0 | 0 
0 | 1 | 0 
0 | 0 | 1
Out: 3
Explanation:
All of the amoebas in the grid are not connected, so they are 3 separate entities

============

Once you've solved how to count the number of amoeba in the Pitri dish,
let's assume that we're able to categorize different species of micro-organisms
on the same Pitri dish. These organsims are all bucketed into the alphabet letters
a-f, for simplicity sake. How would you modify your solution above to count a single
species of amoeba to extend the functionality to output a map that associates
the species category with the number of organisms of that category on the Pitri dish?

Examples: 
In: 5x5 grid
a | a | 0 | c | c
0 | 0 | b | c | 0
f | f | d | b | 0
0 | d | d | 0 | 0 
f | 0 | 0 | f | 0
Out:
{
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 1,
    "d": 1,
    "f": 3
}
Explanation:
Using the same rules as before,
There is one organism of class 'a' spanning (0,0) and (0,1)
There are two organisms of class 'b' because the diagonal rule still applies.
etc
