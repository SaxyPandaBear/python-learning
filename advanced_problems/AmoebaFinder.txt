You're given a rectangular Pitri dish for a computer
to scan. The computer program is able to identify a 
specific species of amoeba within a sector of the 
Pitri dish. The program outputs an N x M grid of 1's 
or 0's. A 1 in the grid indicates that the cell 
contains an amoeba. A 0 indicates there isn't an amoeba 
covering that cell. This is a very particular amoeba that 
only stretches out in the four cardinal directions: north,
south, east, and west. Amoeba will not collide with each other,
and will never stretch diagonally.

The Problem:
============
You are tasked with taking the output of the computer vision 
program and determining how many amoebas exist on the Pitri 
dish. Given a grid of N x M 1's and 0's, return the number 
of amoebas that exist on the dish.

Assumptions:
- 1's that are only connected diagonally do not count as the same entity

Examples: 
In: 5x5 grid
1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1
0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 
1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
Out: 4
Explanation:
At (0,0) there is an amoeba
At (1,1) there is an amoeba
At (3,4) there is an amoeba
There is a single amoeba that spans the coordinates: 
[(0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1)]

In: 3x3 grid
1 | 0 | 0 
0 | 1 | 0 
0 | 0 | 1
Out: 3
Explanation:
All of the amoebas in the grid are not connected, so they are 3 separate entities
