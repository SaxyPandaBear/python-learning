What is a mathematical intersection?
An intersection between two mathematical sets is defined as the 
subset of values that coincide in both sets.

Example:
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A n B = {3}  <- using "n" to denote the intersection operation

The Problem:
============

Given two lists of unique integers (like a set), find the intersection 
of the two lists.

Assumptions: 
- The two lists are guaranteed to be in ascending order
    ex: [1,2,3,4,5] and [2,5,7,10,13]
- The values within a single list will be unique

Grading:
A test suite will be provided which will count for roughly 80% of the assignment. 
The remainder of the grade will be from manual inspection.
