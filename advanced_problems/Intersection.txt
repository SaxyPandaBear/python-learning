What is a mathematical intersection?
An intersection between two mathematical sets is defined as the 
subset of values that coincide in both sets.

Example:
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A n B = {3}  <- using "n" to denote the intersection operation

The Problem:
============

Given two lists of unique integers (like a set), find the intersection 
of the two lists.

Assumptions: 
- The two lists are guaranteed to be in ascending order
    ex: [1,2,3,4,5] and [2,5,7,10,13]
- The values within a single list will be unique (think of the lists as mathematical sets)

Examples:
In: [1,2,3,4,5], [2,5,7,10,13]
Out: [2,5]
Explanation:
2 and 5 are the only values that are shared between the two lists.

In: [1,2,3], [4,5,6]
Out: []
Explanation: 
There are no shared values between the lists, so we return an empty intersection

In: [1], [1]
Out: [1]
Explanation:
The two lists are identical, coincidentally, so we return that same list

In: [1,2,3], []
Out: []
Explanation:
There cannot be a non-empty intersection when one of the sets is the empty set.
Therefore, the only result of an intersection with the empty set should be 
the empty set.
