You're given a sequence of "scenes", for a video clip. 
They are given to you with uniquely identifiable names - 
a scene can be repeated.
Ex: [a, b, c, a, e, f, g, h, e, i, j, k, i]
In this example, there are two scenes in the sequence that 
are identifiable as "a", because they are the same scene.

The Problem:
============
You are tasked with partitioning the sequence of scenes so that 
any scene only appears in once in a partition. Then, you are to 
return a list of counts denoting the length of the partitions.

Assumptions:
- The input list is non-empty


Examples:
In: [a, b, c, a, e, f, g, h, e, i, j, k, i]
Out: [4, 5, 4]
Explanation:
The first partition contains 4 values in it, which are [a,b,c,a]
The second partition contains 5 values in it, which are [e,f,g,h,e]
The third partition contains 4 values in it, which are [i.j,k,i]

In: [a, b, c]
Out: [1, 1, 1]
Explanation:
All of the scenes are entirely unique, so they must be in separate 
partiions.

In: [a, b, c, d, a]
Out: [5]
Explanation: 
All of the scenes can be grouped in one partition
