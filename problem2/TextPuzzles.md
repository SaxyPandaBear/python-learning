Text Puzzles
============

There are functions that need to be written in `puzzles.py`. 

To validate your code, run `python problem2_test.py`

### Reminders / Tips
- Strings in Python are like lists.
- Strings have lots of different [helper functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods) to use 
- Capitalization matters for strings when you compare them against other strings
- You can call other functions that you've written if you think their functionality makes your life easier when doing something more complex
- Use `print(...)` to display text on the screen
- There are a lot of ways to combine variables and strings. [f strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) are the easiest to understand
- If you are trying tp print a character like `"`, you need to escape it with a backslash, like `\"` in order for it to be interpreted properly in Python

### Concepts Focused On
- String operations
- Boolean conditions
- String indexing
- Printing to console
