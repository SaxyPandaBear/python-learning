Class is in Session!
====================

This time you will be writing python files yourself for the first time, 
rather than filling in functions in files that were already given to you, 
but there is still one file to help you see an example that you have to 
fill out. `course.py` has methods in it that need to be filled in.

## Directions

There are a couple classes that need to be written. The files are given but they 
are completely empty. You will have to write all of the code yourself.

##### Student

##### Teacher

##### Cat

##### Dog

##### Cow

### Reminders / Tips
- When you `print()` a class, it will use the `__str__(self)` method to determine how to print the class. Doing `print(something)` turns into `print(str(something))` where `str()` just invokes the `__str__(self)` method of the class.
- If you want to change the functionality of what happens when you call `str(...)`, you need to write your own definition of the `__str__(self)` method.
- Make sure that you always have `self` as the first parameter of every function that you write for a class in Python.
- You can access any value at anytime within a class that was initialized in the `__init__()` function

### Concepts Focused On
- Object Oriented Programming
- Writing classes in Python
